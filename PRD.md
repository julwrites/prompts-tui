# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Prompts TUI

This document outlines the requirements for building a terminal user interface (TUI) for managing prompts for large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary

The Prompts TUI provides a rich, interactive, and visually-oriented terminal interface for managing prompts. It is designed for users who prefer a more guided and graphical experience within their terminal, without leaving the keyboard-centric workflow.

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement

While a CLI is powerful, some users prefer a more visual and interactive way to browse, search, and manage their prompts. A TUI can provide a more intuitive user experience for these users, while still remaining within the terminal environment.

### Solution Approach

The Prompts TUI will be built in Rust using the Ratatui library. It will be an integrated part of the `prompts-cli` binary, launched with a specific command or flag (e.g., `prompts-cli tui`).

### Target Audience

- Developers and power users who spend a significant amount of time in the terminal.
- Users who prefer a more visual and interactive experience than a traditional CLI.
- Those who want to manage their prompts without switching to a full graphical desktop application.

## Product Goals and Success Metrics

| Goal                               | Success Metric                               | Target                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Intuitive prompt management       | User satisfaction and ease of use            | High ratings from user feedback |
| Responsive and performant UI      | Smooth and lag-free user experience          | < 100ms response to user input |
| Seamless integration with CLI     | Easy to launch and exit the TUI from the CLI | Clear and simple commands      |

## User Stories

| Story ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| US-006 | As a terminal user, I want a TUI to browse and manage prompts interactively. | Responsive Ratatui interface with keyboard navigation. | P1 |
| US-010 | As a TUI user, I want to see a list of my prompts with their titles and tags. | A scrollable list of prompts is displayed on launch. | P1 |
| US-011 | As a TUI user, I want to be able to select a prompt and view its full content. | A dedicated view shows the full text of the selected prompt. | P1 |
| US-012 | As a TUI user, I want to be able to edit a prompt's content and metadata directly within the interface. | An editing mode allows for in-place modification of prompts. | P1 |

## Technical Architecture

The TUI will be built in Rust using the Ratatui and Crossterm libraries. It will be a module within the `prompts-cli` crate and will share the same core logic for prompt management.

## Feature Specification

- **Interactive Prompt List**: A scrollable and filterable list of all prompts.
- **Prompt Content View**: A detailed view of the selected prompt's content and metadata.
- **In-TUI Editing**: The ability to edit prompts directly within the TUI.
- **Keyboard-driven Navigation**: Intuitive keybindings for all actions.
- **Help and Documentation**: A help screen that explains the keybindings and features.
